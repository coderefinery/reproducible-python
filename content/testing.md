# Automated testing

- 15 min: Motivation
- 15 min: End-to-end tests
- 15 min: Pytest
- 15 min: Moving to GitHub Actions
- 20 min: Exercise
- 10 min: Where to go from here

Further steps:
- example-based vs. property-based (hypothesis library)
- snapshot based testing (syrupy library) -> regression tests
- mutation testing (mutmut): tests pass -> change a line of code (make a mutant) -> test again and check whether all mutants get "killed"
