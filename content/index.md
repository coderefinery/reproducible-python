# Reproducible research software development using Python


## Big-picture goal

This is a **hands-on course on research software engineering**. In this
workshop we assume that most workshop participants use Python in their work or
a leading a group which uses Python.  Therefore, some of the examples will use
Python as the example language.

We will work with an example project and go through all important steps of a typical
software project.  Once we have seen the building blocks, we will try to **apply
them to own projects**.


## Prerequisites

:::{prereq} Preparation
1. Get a **GitHub account** following [these instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/github/).
1. You will need a **text editor**. If you don't have a favorite one, we recommend
   [VS Code](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/vscode/).
1. **If you prefer to work in the terminal** and not in VS Code, set up these two (skip this if you use VS Code):
   - [Git in the terminal](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/)
   - [SSH or HTTPS connection to GitHub from terminal](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/)
1. **One of these two software environments** (if you are not sure which one to
   choose or have no preference, choose Conda):
   - {ref}`conda`
   - {ref}`venv` (Snakemake is not available in this environment)
1. **Optional** and only on Linux: [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) following
   [these instructions](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.3/installation.html#install-from-pre-built-packages).
